/**
 * An extension of {@link VariableResolver} to have more control to
 * resolve the variables.
 * <p>With {@link VariableResolver}, {@link VariableResolver#resolveVariable}
 * is called to resolve a top-level variable (for example, <code>${a.b.c}</code>
 * where <code>a</code> is a top-level variable).
 * <p>With {@link VariableResolverX}, {@link #resolveVariable(XelContext, Object, Object)}
 * is called to resolve not only top-level variables but also properties
 * (for example, <code>${a.b.c}</code> where <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>
 * are properties).
 * <p>If {@link VariableResolverX} is implemented, {@link VariableResolver#resolveVariable}
 * is ignored. In other words, EL evaluator always invoke
 * {@link #resolveVariable(XelContext, Object, Object)}.
 * <p>Notice you have to follow the same rule to invoke the <code>resolveVariable</code> method.
 * And there is a method called {@link org.zkoss.xel.util.Evaluators#resolveVariable}
 * that can be used to do the job.
